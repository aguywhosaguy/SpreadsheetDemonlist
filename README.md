You probably shouldn't use this. It's slow, made of spaghetti code, and just does things a normal spreadsheet could do, except worse.
If you want to run your own demonlist, try forking the shitty list's repo, then just replacing all the TSL related text and data with your own.

# SpreadsheetDemonlist
A demon list, compiled in a spreadsheet.

## Why
Setting up your own pointercrate website is... tough. So, I decided to make a spreadsheet to make one myself!
I haven't made a stats viewer yet, and probably never will. I'm not that good at programming.
