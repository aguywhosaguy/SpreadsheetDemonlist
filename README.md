# SpreadsheetDemonlist
A demon list, compiled in a spreadsheet.

## Why
Setting up your own pointercrate website is... tough. So, I decided to make a spreadsheet to make one myself!
I haven't made a stats viewer yet, and probably never will. I'm not that good at programming.

## Setting it up
This page is just to document my code for you to look at.
In order to actually make a copy to use the spreadsheet, click [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LNjvfmeXTbkbkq_OzS2mbiqEHev6_zJZynBA6lqgYBQ/copy)
It would be nice if you included a little note saying who made it :)

## How to use
Once it loads, click the "Manage list" button at the top of the screen.
